Hi, I’m a Reference Software Developer at Sngular in Seville. I’m specialised in backend technologies based in the Java ecosystem. Currently I'm working on Microservices using Spring Framework and AWS Cloud technologies. Check out more of my work on my [resume](https://frandorado.github.io/cv/).

In my free time besides mountain biking and other outdoor sports, I like reading about physics and doing research on topics related to electronics, home automation, etc.
